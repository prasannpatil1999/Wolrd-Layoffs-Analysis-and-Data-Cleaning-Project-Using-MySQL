### Project Overview
The World Layoffs Data Analysis project examines global layoff trends across industries, analyzing factors such as total layoffs, percentage of workforce reductions, company stages, and funding status. The goal is to identify patterns, economic impacts, and potential industry vulnerabilities to provide insights into workforce stability and corporate downsizing trends.

### Tools Used
- MySQL

### Data Sources
The "layoffs.csv" file likely contains information about layoffs across various companies, including details such as the company name, number of employees laid off, department, location, and the date of the layoff. This dataset may also include information on reasons for the layoffs, industry sectors affected, and other related factors like company performance or restructuring events.


### Data Cleaning/Preparation
- In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1. Imported data into the MySQL database and conducted an inspection.
2. Removed duplicates, handles missing values and handling Blank values
3. Corrected spelling errors, typos, and inconsistencies.
4. Assigned appropriate data types to columns (e.g., date)
5. Removing col and rows that are not necessaty for analysis

### Key Business Questions Answered
- 1. Maximum laid off in a day
- 2. Where 100% of employees were laid off
- 3. Total laid off by comapnies
- 4. Get date range
- 5. Total laid off by industry
- 6. Total laid off by country
- 7. Total laid off by year
- 8. Total laid off by stage
- 9. Total laid off by MONTH
- 10. Total laid off by companies by year
- 11. Maximum laid off by a company in a year
- 12. Ranking companies by Maximum laid off by a in a year

- Total Layoffs by Company/Industry/Country/Year/Stage: Analyze trends by country, industry, and year to predict future layoffs and assess market stability.
- Laid Off by Month/Company Year: Track peak layoff periods (like 2022) to prepare for workforce shifts in similar economic conditions.
- Recommendations: Monitor heavily affected sectors (Consumer, Retail, Tech) and countries (United States, India) for workforce changes and adjust strategies accordingly.

### Conclusion
